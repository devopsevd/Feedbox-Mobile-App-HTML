                            from users less than 18 years of age has been
                            collected, we will deactivate the account and take
                            reasonable measures to promptly delete such data
                            from our records. If you become aware of any data we
                            may have collected from children under age 18,

                            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems
                            and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
                            ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to
                            signal your privacy preference not to have data
                            about your online browsing activities monitored and
                            collected. At this stage, no uniform technology
                            standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
                            signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
                            currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
                            other mechanism that automatically communicates your
                            choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
                            online tracking is adopted that we must follow in
                            the future, we will inform you about that practice

                            California law requires us to let you know how we
                            respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there
                            currently is not an industry or legal standard for
                            recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not

                            To exercise these rights, you can contact us by
                            submitting a data subject access request, by

                            Under certain US state data protection laws, you can
                            designate an authorized agent to make a request on
                            your behalf. We may deny a request from an
                            authorized agent that does not submit proof that
                            they have been validly authorized to act on your
                            behalf in accordance with applicable laws.

                            Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify
                            your identity to determine you are the same person
                            about whom we have the information in our system. We
                            will only use personal information provided in your
                            request to verify your identity or authority to make
                            the request. However, if we cannot verify your
                            identity from the information already maintained by
                            us, we may request that you provide additional
                            information for the purposes of verifying your
                            identity and for security or fraud-prevention

                            agent, we may need to collect additional information
                            to verify your identity before processing your
                            request and the agent will need to provide a written
                            and signed permission from you to submit such
                            request on your behalf.

                            decline to take action regarding your request, you
                            may appeal our decision by emailing us at

                            the decisions. If your appeal is denied, you may
                            submit a complaint to your state attorney general.
